      <description>Warning This post ended up being pretty long. A million thanks if you make it through to the end.
This week&amp;rsquo;s Perl Weekly Challenge offered two very nice challenges that I really had to think about. Later in the week, Neil Bowers, who is credited with suggesting the second challenge, posted about an additional challenge since his submission was misunderstood.
Now with that out of the way, let me walk you through how I approached these challenges.</description>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve also posted this over on dev.to in case anyone wanted to leave any comments there.
This week&amp;rsquo;s Perl Weekly Challenge had two fairly fun challenges, and a 3rd API challenge that unfortunately needed an additional step I wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to take to participate in (the website required credit card details to use their API at any level).
Challenge 1  Write a script to print the date of last Friday of every month of a given year.</description>

      <description>Fun challenges this week! But first: I&amp;rsquo;m honored to be mentioned in the Perl Weekly Newsletter for the second time now. I&amp;rsquo;m especially honored by the very flattering notion that I&amp;rsquo;m somehow becoming popular with these posts. It&amp;rsquo;s enouraging me to make some time to write about things beyond just these challenges.
Challenge 1  The numbers formed by adding one to the products of the smallest primes are called the Euclid Numbers (see wiki).</description>

      <description>Another Perl Weekly Challenge. I found this week&amp;rsquo;s challenges easier than last week&amp;rsquo;s, which is not bad as I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to stress out over something that is meant to be a learning experience and to keep my skills up.
Challenge 1  Write a script that computes the equal point in the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, knowing that the freezing point of water is 32 °F and 0 °C, and that the boiling point of water is 212 °F and 100 °C.</description>

      <title>Perl Weekly Challenge 10: Roman numerals and Jaro-Winkler distance</title>

      <description>Back at it again with another week of the Perl Weekly Challenge. This time for challenge #10
Challenge #1  Write a script to encode/decode Roman numerals. For example, given Roman numeral CCXLVI, it should return 246. Similarly, for decimal number 39, it should return XXXIX.
 I made the following assumptions for this challenge:
 Valid Roman Numerals follow the &amp;ldquo;Subtractive notation&amp;rdquo; convention mentioned on the Wikipedia page. Only one leading subtractive character is allowed (eg, &amp;lsquo;VIII&amp;rsquo; for &amp;lsquo;8&amp;rsquo;, but not &amp;lsquo;IIX&amp;rsquo;).</description>

      <description>This will be my first ever blog post ever. Hi there!
I decided to blog a bit so that I can write about the process that goes into solving the Perl Weekly Challenge that I recently heard about. I love Perl, challenging myself with programming tasks, and procrastination. It all works out!
So this post will deal with the 9th challenge so far. Check out this challenge, as well as the Perl Weekly Challenge page, here.</description>
